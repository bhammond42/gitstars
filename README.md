Apologies in advance for the terrible content of this Readme...This is my first one. Gotta start somewhere!

This is a project to grab the top starred GitHub projects using PHP (php/import.php), then upload the results to a mysql database, and then display the results. The import can be placed on a schedule or ran whenever needed.

The visual part of this project (index.php) was created with Bootstrap. I used the DataTables library for the table design.

Thanks for taking a look. Have fun and let me know if you can think of any improvements or changes.
